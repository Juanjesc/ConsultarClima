## Why this proyect?

I made this project in order to practice React.js one more time.

It is a real time weather search engine, just put the city and country (it only supports at this moment the ones that appear in the input) and the app will show you the current weather, minimum and maximum temperature.
- This time, the project is initialized with the latest version of Vite, more info here: https://vitejs.dev/guide/ 
- I have implemented useContext, createContext, and custom Hook in order to create a Provider and make my components use a global state without having to pass their values via props.
- Learn about environment variables, why they are necessary.
- For the styles I have used TailwindCSS, see the documentation here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
- For the icons I have used React Icons, more info here: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/
- Finally, the API that makes this application possible has been obtained from the following website: https://openweathermap.org/api.
